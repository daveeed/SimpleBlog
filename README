This is a simple blog app that was created in the spirit of the 'WO in
15 minutes' movie created by Jonathan ‘Wolf’ Rentzsch.

This example application has been designed to showcase ERModernLook
development as well as demonstrate some lesser known page level and
property level components available to the D2W developer in ERModernLook
and the broader ERD2W framework. I hope it will eventually show the
progression of building up and customizing a D2W application.

It depends on ERModernDirectToWeb modifications that are currently
located in my Wonder fork but may end up in Wonder proper.

The application also depends on a FrontBase database. This may change in the
future and/or you may want to change your properties file to point to a
database from a different vendor.

The database you create should be named 'simpleblog' and will start up
with a user with login credentials:

username: test password: test

You will need to change the build.properties file to point to your
installation of Wonder/WebObjects frameworks. It is currently:

wolips.properties=/Developer/WebObjects/Versions/WebObjects543/wolips.
543.properties
